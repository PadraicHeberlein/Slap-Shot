# Slap-Shot
Slap-Shot is essentially a firmware manager and LoRa-to-WiFi linker for the Puck System. It is a terminal-based, text GUI that allows each Puck to communicate with the Puck System GUI on the cloud.

When you first open Slap-Shot, make sure that both the Hockey Stick Base Station and any Pucks you have are unplugged
